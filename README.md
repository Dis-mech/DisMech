Hey there! this is my first website using git pages.
Hybrid Equations Toolbox
The Hybrid Equation (HyEQ) Toolbox provides methods in MATLAB and Simulink for computing and plotting numerical solutions to hybrid dynamical systems.
Contents 
Where to Start:
Depending on your prior experience one of the following pages would be a good place to start learning how to use the HyEQ Toolbox.
If you are unfamiliar with hybrid systems, read [Introduction to Hybrid Systems](https://hyeq.github.io/intro-to-hybrid-systems) for a brief introduction to the mathematical modeling of hybrid systems.
For users of HyEQ Toolbox version 2.40 (and earlier versions), see the guide to quickly converting old code to use new features .
All others should start with the documentation for the HyEQ MATLAB library or the HyEQ Simulink library .
A full list of HyEQ Toolbox help pages is given below.

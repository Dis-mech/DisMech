# DisMech

Hey there! this is my first website using git pages.

Dismech stands for Discrete-Mechanics. It is a codebase that has been developed at the [Structure Computer Interaction Lab](https://structures.computer/) at UCLA to simulate complex soft structures that can be modeled/represented as flexible rods, plates or shells or a network of these basic building block elements. The code is user-friendly and modular and can be easily used to simulate different kind of physical biological structures/ soft robots and so on.

This website is intended to make available this resource to the larger community of interested researchers. The various sections that follow will go over the steps to be able use the code for your own requirements. We have also included some example simulation cases which will help you understand the process better. 

The multirod code can be found here: [gitrepo for the matlab version](https://github.com/Radha-Lahoti/DER-Matlab-MultiRod)
